## Features 📝

The recipes are divided into three categories: *dishes*, *desserts* and *snacks*. Each category contains delicious food recipes 🤤

The application retrieves the data for the different recipes from a **JSON file** which is then linked to an Ionic service.

Thus, with a single service, we can communicate the data required for each recipe 🥘

An **About** page where we can find a description of the app and the author (and contacts too 👀) and a **Settings** page for configuration and FAQ 🤓
